<!--
  I had a dream of a labyrinth, a labyrinth of Borges.
  I a scenario was occuring repeatedly,
  in one scene I was shot in the stomach,
  in another I was begging and convincing,
  in another talking, in another fleeing.
  These scenes were jumbled up, and in the dream state I wasn't lucid -
  until I got shot. But then the scenarios continued without referencing it, as if I hadn't been shot at all.
  On recognising this, and in my near lucid state,
  I had an insight - this was a labyrinth of unresolved trauma.
  Or more accurately, this wasn't a labyrinth at all.
  It had no closure, no loop, no return to the entrance.
  It had no steady path; rather, a thousand entrances, occuring over and over.
  We rely on labyrinths; structures, patterns, paths -
  When we get lost in neverending possibilities, there is no opportunity for recovery.
  Insight can occur as our mind responds naturally to these possibilities
  But to be free from the shattered labyrinth, I'd have to stop entering it.
  Very difficult when there is such emotion and anxiety attached to it,
  But entirely possible. When the trauma is no longer such a big deal,
  it's easier to acknowledge it calmly; when this is possible, it's easier to let other thoughts arise naturally,
  and let these thoughts replace old habitual patterns of thought.
  
  
  (This reminds me of Borges' man who has been condemned to death, imagining every possible way it would occur...)
