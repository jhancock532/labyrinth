  <p>Reflections</p>
  <p>
    The pixels and the image we see are two different things.<br><!--They aren't.-->
    Just as the reflection in a mirror is not the object itself,<br><!--It is.-->
    Just as the map is not the territory.<br><!--There is no difference.-->
    What matters here is the story; the stories within stories, each hinting at other, larger stories.<br>
    <!--What matters here is this story, this story of words and an impossible world elsewhere, a lived experience of reality.-->
    Stories so large that they encompass life, the universe, you.<br>
    <!--A place where concepts do not exist.-->
    Gradually, we will see how everything is a story.<br>
    <br>
    At least, everything that I've written here.<br>
    <!--The walls and path of the labyrinth are as the melding of illusion and reality.-->
