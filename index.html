<!--
  The goal of this website is not to reach the center.html,
  nor to return from the center.html to the entrance.html.

  Your task is to be aware of the journey.
  I offer you no experience other than direct experience itself,

  An experience of our special, quirky internet unreality,
  felt through the plastic of our keyboards, mice, touchscreens,
  seen so directly to us, with such predictable cause and effect!

  The performance of the internet is cheap,
  but only as we are cheap spectators - clicking for quick fixes
  see how weak your patience and frustrations are online

  Do not demand ever brighter beauty,
  accept the discomforts of the present,
  perceive the beauty already there.

  Take an opportunity to set aside your filters and expectations
  stay with me, for a moment, in this space of passings
